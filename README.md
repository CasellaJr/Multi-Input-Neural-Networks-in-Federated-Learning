# Multi-Input-Neural-Networks-in-Federated-Learning

This repository contains the code used to train a Multi-Input Neural Network (NN) in a centralized (standard Deep Learning) and in a federated setting using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and the Intel [OpenFL](https://openfl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) framework. The Multi-Input NN consists of a [ResNet-18](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet18.html) concatenated with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).

Extensive experiments have been executed in a centralized and in a federated scenarios, testing a Multi-Input NN with a ResNet-18 or with an MLP, over two datasets:
- [CoViD-19 CXR](https://ai4covid-hackathon.it/)
- [ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/)
